# MAPD Fil Rouge PetriNet

This project was developed for IMT Atlantique's Collaborative Development course. It consists in an implementation
of a Petri Net model in Java. Adapters were then written to include our model in an existing Petri Net Editor (PNE) app.

Our model classes can be found in the package org.pneditor.petrinet.models.kc and their respective adapters in
org.pneditor.petrinet.adapters.kc

A class diagram is also included in the diagrams package.
